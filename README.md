Hello Everyone!


I hope you are all doing well today, my name is Matthew McFall and for my first practicum presentation, I will be presenting on my analysis of the geospatial data given on Kaggle.com for criminal offenses in the City and County of Denver for the previous five calendar years plus the current year to date. The main idea behind this project was to see if you could effectively use supervised and unsupervised technics to classify criminal incidents effectively thus predicting the likelihood of which crime will occur when and in what area.
